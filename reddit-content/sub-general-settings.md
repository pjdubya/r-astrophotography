/r/astrophotography went private for a period of 10 days in protest of reddit's proposed API changes, and unprofessional response to the community's concerns regarding 3rd party apps, mod tools, and accessibility options that have been impacted by this decision. 

Despite [community vote](https://imgur.com/a/3aKZE0o), we reopened with a new set of guidelines as chosen and approved by the community.
